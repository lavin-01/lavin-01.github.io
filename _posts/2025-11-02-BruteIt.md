# BRUTE IT NOTES
## Task 1: Deploy the machine

### Objective is to learn how to:
1. Do a reconnaissance
2. Brute force
3. Hash cracking
4. Privilege escalation

The first thing to do is to connect to the THM network via VPN or you can use the attack box

## Task 2: Reconnaissance

1. **How many ports are open?**

Using the command nmap -A -sV MACHINE_IP we see that only two ports are open. Namely:

1. ssh port 22/tcp
2. http port 80/tcp
