# OWASP Juice Shop Write-up

## Task 1: Introduction

The OWASP Juice Shop room provides a guided, interactive environment for investigating vulnerable online applications. Through a methodology that mimics contemporary penetration testing techniques, we get to engage directly with Juice Shop's vulnerabilities, which range from injection problems and faulty authentication to vulnerable setups. This room offers an approachable yet thorough environment for developing and honing web application security abilities.

### Set Up:

1. **Deploy the Attack box** or use **OpenVPN** to connect to the same network the machine is on
2. **Start the machine** in the first task and wait for a few minutes for it to load
3. **Confirm connectivity** by pinging the IP address generated to ensure you are connected to the same network as the machine
