# Malaria Prediction Model with AI
## Description
This project focuses on building an AI-powered malaria prediction model that leverages both medical image data and patient health indicators. The primary dataset consists of eyelid images, which are analyzed alongside additional clinical data such as hemoglobin (HB) levels, body temperature, reports of muscle pain, and headache occurrences.

The dataset was sourced from Roboflow, ensuring quality preprocessing and annotation of image samples. On the development side, the system integrates a Node.js backend for handling data flow and API interactions, while MongoDB is utilized to efficiently manage, store, and retrieve both patient information and prediction outcomes.

By combining computer vision techniques with structured health data, the project aims to improve malaria screening and provide a scalable, accessible diagnostic support tool for healthcare settings, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

# TI Data Analytics
## Description
This project explores how student engagement in a Learning Management System (LMS) influences academic performance. By analyzing behavioral data such as logins, time spent, submissions, and interactions, the study identifies patterns that can predict student outcomes. The objective was to uncover early indicators of academic success or risk, enabling timely interventions by educators.

Using Python, statistical analysis, and machine learning models such as Random Forest and Decision Trees, the project evaluated key engagement metrics including course access minutes, interaction counts, and session duration. Feature importance and interpretability tools like SHAP values revealed that consistent activity and timely submissions are strong predictors of higher performance.

The findings highlight the potential of data-driven insights to improve educational outcomes. By monitoring LMS engagement patterns, institutions can proactively identify at-risk students, refine teaching strategies, and ultimately enhance learning experiences.
